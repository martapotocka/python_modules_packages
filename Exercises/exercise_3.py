# Create a new package and call it music
# Create a two modules within this package: britney and iron_maiden
# In britney create a function sing() which prints "Ups I did it again"
# In iron_maiden create a function sing() which prints "666 the number of the beast"
# Do not forget about the special file which has to be in the package!

# Run britney and iron_maiden from this file using package_name.module_name.function_name

# Run britney and iron_maiden from this file using only module_name.function_name

# Run britney and iron_maiden from this file using only function name
# If you observe some problem, try to fix it

# (remember you have a couple of import possibilities to choose! )
